For A4:
Finish floor and wall config
---
For later versions:
Animation when not auto-reloading - wont work without complete rewrite
Non-uniform walls, fluids, etc
Add configurable key bindings
Interrupt driven input- debounce keys?
Better creature name handling- special characters? Capitals? nicknames?
Alpha transparency?
Better ramp handling- Big lookup table?
Status indicators?
Objects?
XML for trees, etc
Dealing with unloaded underground chunks
Look into reducing block new/delete for performance
Multiple XML files for other types of sprites
Multiple image files for other types of sprites
Floor sprites with different material types? Layered floor sprites ala buildings?
---
Things to keep an eye on:
Crashers with odd materials etc
Crashers with saving/loading
