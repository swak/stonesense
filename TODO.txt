For A4:
Finish floor and wall config
Properly handle bad DF connections- seems ok?
---
For later versions:
Animation when not auto-reloading - wont work without complete rewrite
Add configurable key bindings
Interrupt driven input
Alpha transparency?
Better ramp handling- Big lookup table?
Status indicators?
Objects?
