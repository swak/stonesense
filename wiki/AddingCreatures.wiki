=Adding Creatures to Stonesense=
Adding new creatures to Stonesense is fairly easy, but before reading this guide I suggest you familiarize yourself with how Stonesense deals with creature [Sprites].


==Creatures.xml==
Stonesense is fully configurable in the way it renders creatures. No information is hardcoded, but rather loaded from the creature database found in *Creatures.xml*.

The structure of this file is fairly simple:
{{{
<Creature gameID="dwarf" 	sheetIndex = 1  /> 
<Creature gameID="cat" 		sheetIndex = 20 /> 
<Creature gameID="dog" 		sheetIndex = 21 /> 
}}}

As you can see, each creature is identified by a *'gameID'* attribute. This has to match one of the known creature types in Dwarf Fortress. This gameID tag is not case sensitive. If Stonesense is unable to match your gameID with one from Dwarf Fortress, a log message will be written to _Stonesense.log_ upon loading a map.

When trying to render a creature, Stonesense will look up its gameID in this table and render the sprite from the creatures sprite sheet with the mathcing Sheet Index.
