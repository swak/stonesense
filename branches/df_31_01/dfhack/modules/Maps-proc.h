// read region surroundings, get their vectors of geolayers so we can do translation (or just hand the translation table to the client)

/**
    Method for reading the geological surrounding of the currently loaded region.
    assign is a reference to an array of nine vectors of unsigned words that are to be filled with the data
    array is indexed by the BiomeOffset enum

    I omitted resolving the layer matgloss in this API, because it would
    introduce overhead by calling some method for each tile. You have to do it
    yourself. First get the stuff from ReadGeology and then for each block get
    the RegionOffsets. For each tile get the real region from RegionOffsets and
    cross-reference it with the geology stuff (region -- array of vectors, depth --
    vector). I'm thinking about turning that Geology stuff into a
    two-dimensional array with static size.

    this is the algorithm for applying matgloss:
    void DfMap::applyGeoMatgloss(Block * b)
    {
        // load layer matgloss
        for(int x_b = 0; x_b < BLOCK_SIZE; x_b++)
        {
            for(int y_b = 0; y_b < BLOCK_SIZE; y_b++)
            {
                int geolayer = b->designation[x_b][y_b].bits.geolayer_index;
                int biome = b->designation[x_b][y_b].bits.biome;
                b->material[x_b][y_b].type = Mat_Stone;
                b->material[x_b][y_b].index = v_geology[b->RegionOffsets[biome]][geolayer];
            }
        }
    }
