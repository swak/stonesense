Welcome to this alpha screening of Stonesense!

Thank you for testing out our little visualizer,
we appreciate any feedback.
Please remember this is just an alpha, 
so there are (still) tons of features to be added, 
and I'm sure, quite a few bugs too.

Make sure you have DF running, with your game loaded. 

If all you see is a blank screen, DON'T PANIC.
This just means you're viewing a hidden area.
Use the coordiantes in the upper left to move up or down till you hit the surface.

The system tries to avoid reading when theres no valid map, but it will still
occasionally get the timing and die


Good Luck!
