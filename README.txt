Welcome to Stonesense Slate RC1 (2.0)

Thank you for trying out our little visualizer,
as always, we appreciate any feedback.

Please note, that for the time being Stonesense Slate ONLY supports DF 31_1, through 31_12.
Make sure you have DF running, with your game loaded.

IF Stonesense should at any time lock up, it might happen that DF freezes.
If this happens just kill of the Stonesense.exe process (if it didn't die on itself)
and use the dfunstuck.exe utility supplied with this distribution.
