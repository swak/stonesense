There are ten thousand things to say here, and I'll get into more details later,
but for now; This project aint all that compiler friendly yet.
I'm just getting the project out there, so the public light will force me to tidy up stuff.


1 - You will need Allegro, the graphics library we use. Get it at http://alleg.sourceforge.net/

2 - I've only tested it with MSVS 2005

3 - It includes a partially mangled version of dfHack. It should work, but a more elegant solution is in the works.
