All tiles in stonesense use a single system to define them, using XML tags and attributes. the tag that defines a sprite is diifferent for each type, but the attributes are the same.

All sprites have the following format:

<tag attribute1="value1" attribute2="value2" ... >
	<subtag attribute="val"/>
	...
</tag>

where 'tag' is the identifier for the type of sprite in question, attribute is one of the many possible sprite attributes, and val is a value for that attribute. 

This is a list of possible sprite attributes, and associated values.

Attribue: sheetIndex, sprite, index
Valid Values: Any positive number
Default Value: "-1"
Description: This is the single most important attribute of any sprite. It referrs to the the location of the sprite on the tileset, starting from 0 in the upper left, and going down a row every 20 sprites.

Attribute: file
Valid Values: any valid image file
Default Value: "objects.png"
Description: describes which file (called "sprite sheet") the sprite can be found in. Sprite sheet can be defined on an XML-file level too, this way all sprites listen in the XML-file use the same file so it doesn't have to be set for every sprite (local definitions will override the global ones).

Attribue: frames
Valid Values: any combinatio of the numbers 0-5
Default Value: "012345"
Description: This is used for animating a sprite, it is a list of frames that the sprite can show up on, with a random offset per sprite. so a value of "024" would mean that the sprite would show up every other frame.

Attribute: random_anim_offset
Valid values: "0", "1"
Default Value: "0"
Description: some sprites are better if hte animations on different tiles are out of synch with each other, while others need to match. Setting this to "1" will add a random number of frames to each tile.
Attribute: needopen
Valid Values: any combination of the numbers 0-8
Default Value: "12345678"
Description: this is a list of adjascent tiles that would be empty for this sprite to be shown. numbers refer to the following tiles:
              /\
             /  \
            /    \
           /\ 1  /\                  
          /  \  /  \                   
         / 8  \/ 2  \                  
        /\    /\    /\                
       /  \  /  \  /  \                
      / 7  \/    \/ 3  \               
      \    /\    /\    /               
       \  /  \  /  \  /                
        \/ 6  \/ 4  \/                 
         \    /\    /                  
          \  /  \  /                   
           \/ 5  \/                    
            \    /                     
             \  /                      
              \/                       
In order for the sprite to be shown, at least one of the listed numbers must contain an empty space. However, this can be over-rided by the next two attributes, which can also allow the sprite to be shown on their own conditions. Setting this value to "0" means that the sprite will not over-ride the next two attributes.

Attribute: needfloor
Valid Values: any combination of the numbers 0-8

Attribute: variations
Valid values: and positive number
Default Value: "0"
Description: This is used for giving random variation to sprites. If this number is more than 0, a random number between 0 and this number-1 is added to the sheetIndex. eg, if this attribute is 5 and sheetIndex is 21, then tiles will range from 21-25

Attribute: color
Valid Values: "none", "xml", "material", "layer", "vein", "building", "material_fore", "material_back", "layer_fore", "layer_back", "vein_fore", "vein_back", "bodypart", "profession", "blood"
Default Value: "none"
Description: Sets how this sprite is colored. 
	"none" means the sprite is not colored
	"xml" means the sprite color is specified using the red, green, and blue sprite attributes shown later.
	"Material" means that the sprite will be colored according to the material of the sprite that shows up in DF. adding this to creatures results in chameleons.
	"layer" means that the sprite will be colored according to the main rock layer, which lies beneath all veins and constructions.
	"vein" means that the sprite will be colored according to the mineral vein, which lies beneath constructions, but is above the layer.
	"building" means that the sprite will be colored according to the building that is built on it. it's probably a bad idea to use this one outside of building sprites.
	"material_fore", "material_back", "layer_fore", "layer_back", "vein_fore", and "vein_back" are currently waiting for DFhack to update it's features. they may or may not work.
	"bodypart" meanst that this sprite is colored according to a creature's body part, specified later. adding this to a landscape sprite will result in the sprite being colored only when a creature is on it.
	"profession" means that the sprite will be colored according to the creature's profesion.
	"blood" means that the sprite will be colored according to whatever blood is splattered onto it.

Additional sprites can be layered on top using the subsprite tag, like so:

<floors>
	<floor sheetindex="1">
		blah blah
		<subsprite sheetIndex="2" color="material"/>
	</floor>
</floors>

you can add as many subsprites as you need.

Remember that most of these can be applied to any and all sprites, so you can have dwarves leann against a wall if they are standing next to one, or have a willow tree that is leaning over the edge of a cliff, that gets snowed over in winter.

however, some of them don't fit well in some situations, like making a rock floor colored by skin tone, or a dorf's clothing being colored according to the rock he's standing on, but the option is there.
