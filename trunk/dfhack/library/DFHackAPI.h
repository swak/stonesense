    /**
        Method for reading the geological surrounding of the currently loaded region.
        assign is a reference to an array of nine vectors of unsigned words that are to be filled with the data
        array is indexed by the BiomeOffset enum

        I omitted resolving the layer matgloss in this API, because it would
        introduce overhead by calling some method for each tile. You have to do it
        yourself. First get the stuff from ReadGeology and then for each block get
        the RegionOffsets. For each tile get the real region from RegionOffsets and
        cross-reference it with the geology stuff (region -- array of vectors, depth --
        vector). I'm thinking about turning that Geology stuff into a
        two-dimensional array with static size.

        this is the algorithm for applying matgloss:
        void DfMap::applyGeoMatgloss(Block * b)
        {
            // load layer matgloss
            for(int x_b = 0; x_b < BLOCK_SIZE; x_b++)
            {
                for(int y_b = 0; y_b < BLOCK_SIZE; y_b++)
                {
                    int geolayer = b->designation[x_b][y_b].bits.geolayer_index;
                    int biome = b->designation[x_b][y_b].bits.biome;
                    b->material[x_b][y_b].type = Mat_Stone;
                    b->material[x_b][y_b].index = v_geology[b->RegionOffsets[biome]][geolayer];
